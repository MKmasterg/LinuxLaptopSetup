# Chosing the desired workspace!

 - Desktop Environment (like [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) or [KDE](https://kde.org/)) : Most distros including fedora use DE, because they are user-friendly and they come with a lot of utilities (like audio configs) that a mere Window Manager doesn't have.
 - Window Manager (like [awesome](awesomewm.org) or [i3](i3wm.org)): They don't have utilities like DEs and they are NOT user-friendly :| but when you learn how to work with them, you're gonna love WM. because you can navigate through windows and workspaces without using mouse (or less using mouse), like who doesn't want that?!
 I personally use both of them.
