# Awesome!

Typically window managers are tricky and I still can't figure out most of the things! but at least I'm satisfied at the look and feel of awesome wm that I configured.

# Theme
I actually don't care about theming, but yeah even I need a comfy workspace to work with!
So I chose the [copy-cats themes](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats), they are beautiful and easy to work with. I chose Black Burn for now. You can follow the instructions in the repo but I've already put my configs (that comes from the copy-cats themes rc.lua template) in mu repository, but make sure you install the dependencies.  

# Configs
The configs are not a big deal, everything is in the `rc.lua` (better put your settings in your home directory at `.configs/`, if not exist you can usually find the templates at 

    /etc/xdg/
    #or 
    /usr/share 
   make a copy of them and put them in your home directory.)
BTW make sure you install the [Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton), because of the startup apps at the end of the config file.
